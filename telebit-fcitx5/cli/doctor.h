// `telebit doctor` — judge the input-method plumbing and say what to fix.
//
// The division of labour with fcitx5-diagnose is deliberate. That tool is
// mature at inspecting the host (locales, ldd, immodule caches) and there is no
// value in reimplementing it, but it has four blind spots this command exists
// to cover:
//
//   1. it cannot see inside a Flatpak or Snap sandbox, which is where the
//      module an app needs either exists or does not;
//   2. it reads the environment of the shell it runs in, not the environment
//      the graphical session actually handed to the apps;
//   3. it does not identify the compositor, which on Wayland decides the whole
//      correct configuration;
//   4. it treats "GTK_IM_MODULE != fcitx" as an error, which upstream no
//      longer recommends on Plasma/Wayland.
//
// So doctor reports on those and points at fcitx5-diagnose for the rest.
